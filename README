Tk-CanvasDirTree version 0.03
=============================

zentara <zentara@zentara.net> - The Distribution Maintainer

INCLUDED WIDGETS:
Tk::CanvasDirTree - a directory browser based on a Derived Tk::Canvas

ADDITIONAL SCRIPTS:
z-lighten  -  an Imager based script to make "lightened" images for
              backgrounds used with dark font fills
	      
z-charcoal - an ImageMagick based script to make an artistic charcoal	      
             drawing for backgrounds.

	     
DESCRIPTION:
This widget reads a directory tree, in an efficient manner, and provides
an intuitive graphical interface to selecting them. It only recurses 2 levels
at a time, so it is efficient on deeply nested trees. 
It is similar in appearance to the Gtk2 TreeView. Colors and fonts are
configurable, as well as a background image (with configurable location placement).
Due to the wide variety of possible color schemes, creating a pleasing 
background image is left to you. See the perldoc for suggestions.
